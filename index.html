          <h2>About The Model</h2>

          <p>
            The 2025 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross delivers a strong mix of
            turbocharged performance and everyday practicality. Powered by a
            1.5L MIVEC Turbo 4-cylinder with 152 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, it
            pairs seamlessly with an 8-speed sport mode CVT for smooth
            acceleration. Drivers can choose between Front-Wheel Drive or
            Mitsubishi Super All-Wheel Control for added traction in any
            condition. Fuel efficiency stays reasonable at around 9.6 L/100 km
            city and 8.9 L/100 km highway, while a 1,500 lb towing capacity adds
            versatility when needed.
